# Documentation

## Project Overview

Baristeuer is a desktop application for generating tax reports for non-profit organizations in Germany. It uses Go for the backend and a React frontend styled with Tailwind CSS. The application is bundled with Wails so it can run as a native program.

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Go**: Language for all backend logic.
- **Wails**: Framework for building the desktop application.
- **SQLite**: Lightweight database used through `database/sql`.

### Frontend
- **React**: UI library for building the interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Vite**: Development server and build tool.

## Directory Structure

- `cmd/`: Application entry point and Wails setup.
- `docs/`: Documentation files (`Changelog.md`, `DOCUMENTATION.md`, `TODO123.md`).
- `internal/`: Core application logic.
  - `data/`: Data models and SQLite storage.
  - `pdf/`: PDF generation utilities.
  - `taxlogic/`: Business logic for tax calculations for German non-profits.
  - `ui/`: React frontend source code.
- `scripts/`: Helper scripts for development.

## Key Features

- **React + Tailwind Interface**: UI built with React components styled using Tailwind.
- **PDF Generation**: Creates detailed tax reports in PDF format for submission to the German tax office.
- **SQLite Storage**: Simple persistence layer to store project data.
- **Unit Tests**: Tests covering the tax calculation logic.

## Cross-Platform Compatibility
The application is required to be fully functional on both **macOS** and **Windows** operating systems. All features must be tested and verified on both platforms to ensure a consistent user experience.

## Final Project Assessment

### Current State
The Baristeuer application is feature-complete, stable, and meets all core requirements. The backend, built with Go, provides robust tax calculation and data management logic. The React-based frontend, styled with Tailwind CSS, offers an intuitive and responsive user interface. The application has been successfully tested on both macOS and Windows, ensuring cross-platform compatibility.

### Production Readiness
The project is considered production-ready. The CI/CD pipeline is fully operational, automating builds and tests to ensure code quality and reliability. The documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date, providing clear guidance for users and developers.

### Potential Next Steps
While the application is complete, future enhancements could include:
- **Advanced Reporting:** Adding more detailed analytics and customizable report templates.
- **Cloud Sync:** Implementing an optional cloud synchronization feature for backing up and sharing data across devices.
- **Plugin System:** Developing a plugin architecture to allow for third-party extensions and integrations.
