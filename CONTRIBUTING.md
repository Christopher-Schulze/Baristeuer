# Contributing to Baristeuer

Thank you for considering a contribution!

## Branching Strategy
- Create a new branch for each change based on `main`.
- Use descriptive names such as `feature/<topic>` or `bugfix/<issue>`.
- Open a pull request targeting `main` when your work is ready for review.

## Coding Conventions
- Format Go code with `go fmt` before committing.
- Keep JavaScript and React files formatted using Prettier.
- Ensure the project builds without errors using `go build ./...` and `npm run build` for the UI.
- Write tests for new functionality when possible.
